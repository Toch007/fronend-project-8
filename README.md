## My process

I broke down the page into sections which made the process a lot more easier for me. I used the mobile-first workflow, then i used media queries for the desktop designs

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learns more on how to work with and manipulate SVG elements. I also improved my styling skills with grid and flexbox.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

This is the code which enabled me adjust the size of the SVG item
<h1>viewBox="0 0 125 120"</h1>

### Continued development

I still need to work more on using SVG items. I need to work on my time management and my work-flow.

### Useful resources

- [align-items, justify-items](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me a lot with the project because I was a bit confused differentiating them.
- [@media only Screen and ()](https://www.codecademy.com) - This will continue to be the go to place for the best tutorials in coding and sharpening your skills.
